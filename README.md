# ghostwriter theme
**ghostwriter** is my debut Tumblr theme, a project that combines my newfound knowledge of JavaScript with the HTML/CSS skills I gained from university lectures and self-study. I created this theme for my main Tumblr account, which you can visit here: thehtmlghost.tumblr.com.

## key features
- Responsive design: It adapts to devices like tablets and mobile phones, being switched from a two-column layout to a single-column one, with the sidebar acting as a header.
- Light mode switch: This was my biggest challenge and my proudest achievement! With a single click, the theme's colors invert, offering blog owners full customization through meta tags. The toggle itself dynamically switches between a sun and moon icon, reflecting the current mode!
- Customizable layout: It offers the option to change post width and margins directly from the Tumblr customization panel, without having to dig into the code. For even more unique designs, direct code edits are, of course, still possible.
- Modified PXU Photoset Script: By integrating [this](https://bychloethemes.tumblr.com/post/155956945114/modified-pxu-photoset-script-modified-by) widget by Chloe Themes, **ghostwriter** provides a larger, improved view of images when clicked, and ensures a consistent design for all photosets, regardless of the number of images.
- NPF images fix v3.0: [This](https://glenthemes.tumblr.com/post/659034084446748672/npf-v3-2021) widget by Glen Themes significantly enhances the appearance of New Post Format (NPF) images, which include photos uploaded via mobile (that are treated as text posts) or images embedded within paragraphs.
